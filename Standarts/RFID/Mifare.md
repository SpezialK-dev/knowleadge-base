Mifare Tags work on [13.56Mhz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE) 
# Reading and writing tags

## IOS
as it appears IOS [does not](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/133179) support reading of Mifare Classic 1K cards. You can use an external reader to still read them but it does not work out of the box as it does under android. Other Mifare standarts [seem supported](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/nfcmifaretag).
