# Some general Info from the Data sheet

It uses the master coil from that it gets from the antenna 


- Operation frequency : 100 -150kHz
- clonable via a flipper

quite simple design


READ ONLY - you will destroy the tag if you try to write to it 

> By turning on and off the modulation current, the chip will send back the 64 bits of information contained in a factory pre-programmed memory array.
## How the tags are programmed 

Quoting from the manual :
> The programming of the chip is performed by laser fusing of polysilicon links in order to store a unique code on each chip
