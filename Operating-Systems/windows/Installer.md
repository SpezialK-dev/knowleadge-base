# Windows 11 installer 

IF you have a problem with the installer not scalling correctly there is a sliggght workaround for thhat and that is.to simply use the old installer. 

the big problem with the new one is you can only get until the liscence terms and there enter wont get you any further.

So you only need get to the screen where at the bottom you can select: use old installer. Select that one it shooould work on really zommed in installers aswell.
