## Some aquired knowleadge 

- it lets you access all physical memory
- this also mapps some IO things, things like your GPU mem and other peripherals might also be in this 
- CONFIG\_STRICT\_DEVMEM makes the kernel check addresses in
- you can bypass it with a kernel modul like fmem
- The readable part is capped at 1MB you can check this yourself with the following command 


```shell
sudo cat /dev/mem | wc
```
your result should look similar to this 
```result 
    824    4850 1048576
```
only the last part is relevant it should be the same for you. [This information was taken from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6134984/access-permissions-of-dev-mem)

### Some new tooling 

Since /dev/mem has a limit you might want to either use 
- [Lime](https://github.com/504ensicslabs/lime)
- [fmem](https://github.com/NateBrune/fmem)
both are unmaintained and would allow you to do a similar thing. If you just want to read memory


## Actually doing it 


you could do it like this 

```shell
sudo hexdump -C --skip 0x0005000 /dev/mem | head
```

0x0100000(00f0000) apears to be the highest possible address we can read out with sudo privilages under a normal arch install.
