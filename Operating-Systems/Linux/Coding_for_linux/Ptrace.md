# Introduction 

> The **ptrace**() system call provides a means by which one process
 (the "tracer") may observe and control the execution of another
  process (the "tracee"), and examine and change the tracee's
 memory and registers.  It is primarily used to implement
 breakpoint debugging and system call tracing.
