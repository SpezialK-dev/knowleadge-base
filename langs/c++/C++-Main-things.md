# Some smaller things

## Typedef 

usage
```c++
typdef int* name
```
we now can the name name instead of using int*
these types can be a lot more complex though and dont just need to be this easy

# Preprocessor things
cause you can do a lot of magic with the preprocessor
## include guards

```c++
//class_obj.h

#ifndef class_obj_h
#define class_obj_h

class class_obj_h{

}
#endif
