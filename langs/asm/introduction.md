# How computers work

**Instructions** is the way that computers know what calculation is next in line to be processed

first instruction 

## halt instruction 

*halt* -> halts the program execution

rules : one instruction per line
the halt intstruction is important cause it signales the computer to stop reading the memory. If you dont specify this the computer could continue reading and you would have an out ouf bounds read which is dangerous.
Halt tells the computer where the end of the program is.
