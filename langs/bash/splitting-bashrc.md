A more explicit small scale project. 

# Motivation 

since I often create different bashrc's for different hosts but I would still like to have a certain set of default aliases and scripts. Hence I want to seperate them and also improve my dotfiles script.

To do that I want to split my .bashrc into different files and also make it so that my script adds the line to load the new ones automatically. 


# Ways of achieving this

simply using this cmd in the script 

```shell
source /path/to/script
```
