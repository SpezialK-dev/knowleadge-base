# Getting the decompilers
even if cutter is not really a debugging tool I will just count it here. If you are installing the simple arch package, you are most likely missing the decompilers 

on arch linux they are the following packages 
- [rz-Ghidra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rz-ghidra/)
- [rz-jsdec](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rz-jsdec)
