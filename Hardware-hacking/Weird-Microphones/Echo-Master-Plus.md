# Pinout connector

These might be correct, no guarantees given 


| Pin number | likely function                                | actual function |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1          | white wire                                     | Audio           |
| 2          | GND                                            | GND             |
| 3          | light green wire (seems to be the sending pin) | RX              |
| 4          | light brown wire                               | TX              |
1. The send pin 

3. gives out around 600 -700mV when pressing down the red button. Otherwise its 0V  

4.  gives out a constant voltage around 200-300mV when not pressing down the red button. This turns to 0 V when the red button is pressed down
#### Possible pin out grafics

So either we have 1 4 Pin Midland or a Royce since both of them are equal it does not matter to us.

The yellow wire at the bottom is GND

the light brown and light green wires mentioned at the top are the ones that are above the red button. 

The green and blue yellow that go out of image, go to the LED that lights up when the red button is pressed down.
